# Coding workflows.

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task. 
- Ensure correct python best practices are following in terms of layout (src, main.py, config, CRUD, services, etc)
- Write tests for all major functionality. 
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns at architecture of how a feature works after it has shows to work well, unless explicitly instructed. 
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes.
